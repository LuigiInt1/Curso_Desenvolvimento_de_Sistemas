Objectives
Familiarize the student with:

Fixing errors in a program
Floating point numbers
Printing on screen
Scenario
Check the program in the editor. Find all possible compilation errors and logic errors. Fix them.

Your version of the program must print the same result as the expected output. Before you use the compiler, try to find the errors only by manual code analysis.

Expected output
The value of seven is: 7.000000
The value of eight and a half is: 8.500000*/


#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
	printf("The value of seven is: %f\n", 7.0);
	printf("The value of eight and a half is: %f\n", 8.5);
	return 0;
}
